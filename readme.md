## Folder sharing

The CLI can share local directories with connected peers using command-line
flags. By default, no folders are exposed. Use `--read <PATH>` to grant
read-only access to a directory and `--write <PATH>` to grant read/write
access. You can specify the flags multiple times to share additional
directories.
